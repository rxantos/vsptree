VSPTree is a graphical tool for that started with the Visual Studio 2008 Standalone Profiler. It now works with Remote Tools for Visual Studio 2012 and has been tested on Windows 8 x64.


It is named so because it gives you a tree view of the calltree generated from VSP files generated by the profiler.
